  "description": "An object representing an relation element. Mandatory fields: constant \"type\": \"Class\", \"id\", \"name\", \"stereotype\", \"properties\", \"propertyAssignments\". The \"properties\" array must have at least two items and is not nullable. The order of these items represents their position on a equivalent predicate, e.g., in the ternary relation \"buys-product-from(buyer,product,seller)\", the order of items representing these entities must follow the order \"buyer\" (in properties[0]), \"product\" (in properties[1]), and \"seller\" (in properties[2]). Relation elements are also used to represent derivation relations, in which case they must contain the stereotype \"derivation\" and have only 2 properties, the first being a Relation element and the second a Class element. Additional fields NOT allowed. Ordered properties.",
